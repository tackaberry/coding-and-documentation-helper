What is Cloud Shell?,"A web-based terminal environment that allows you to: Access and manage GCP resources; Develop and test code; and, Learn and explore GCP. Key features include: a pre-configured environment; integrated authentication; a persistent home directory: and, it is free and accessible. Think of Cloud Shell as a convenient and portable way to interact with your GCP environment, especially useful for quick tasks, learning, and initial setup. It promotes agility and simplifies development and management of your cloud infrastructure."
What is GitOps?,"An operational framework that integrates Git version control with infrastructure and application deployment, enabling declarative, auditable, and automated management of cloud-native systems. It leverages the following key principles: Declarative Configuration (eg. uses manifest files like YAML); Single Source of Truth (eg. source is git); CI/CD Pipeline (eg. its automated); and, Automated Reconciliation (eg. operators can easily ensure the system converges to desired state)."
What is Infrastructure as code (IaC)?,"refers to the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure resources using code instead of manual configuration. This code defines infrastructure components like virtual machines, storage buckets, and network configurations in a declarative way, allowing for: Automation, Version Control, Repeatability, and Scalability. Think of IaC like a blueprint for your cloud infrastructure, allowing you to build and manage it in a controlled, versioned, and scalable manner."
What is Kubernetes (k8s)?,"A powerful open-source system used for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts. In the context of this repo, the 'PubSec Declarative Toolkit', Kubernetes is used with Kubernetes Config Connector and Config Controller to deploy a Landing Zone."
What is the cloud?,"The cloud is a metaphor for the Internet. It refers to software and services that run on the Internet instead of locally on your computer. Most cloud services can be accessed through a Web browser like Firefox or Google Chrome, and some companies offer dedicated mobile apps."
What is Google Cloud Pllaform (GCP)?,"Google Cloud Platform, offered by Google, is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search, Gmail, file storage, and YouTube."
How do I get started with this toolkit?,"To get started with this toolkit, you can follow the instructions in the README.md file in the root of the repository."
